Legends: Everflower is a game made in Windows using the Unity engine.
The Mac and Linux builds are untested.

Known Bugs:
-The lines that appear when moving around, ignore it, its just a visual bug
-Collision boxes, you might get stuck on a wall, just move away from it and continue in the same direction

Both of the bugs are due to an external program I made the map in called 'Tiled' and imported to Unity using 'Tiled2Unity'.

There is no begging or end to the game, you are in a dungeon filled with slimes, you have a wooden sword that, if it touches the slime, will 'kill' the slime.
If the slimes touch you, the game will restart, you will be put back to the beginning and the slimes will respawn.

Rough Story:
You are an adventurer set on a quest to find the Everflower, a magical flower that does not die. You are looking to retrieve this flower for the king so the royal mages can extract the magic of infinate life and apply it to the soldiers to win the everlasting war between the humans and the orcs.


The game is a proof of consept and is my most completed game to date.
If I were to complete the game, this is what I would include:
-A sword swinging animation.
-A town you start in.
-A story to put you on the adventure.
-A secret grove within the nearby forest where you find the dungeon the game takes place in.
-The chest would open and reveal the Everflower safely preserved within a bottle.
-An obtainable sword better than the one you carry within the dungeon.
-Skellitons that throw bones at you
-A life system
-A checkpoint system
